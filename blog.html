                    <p>
                        Protein Source
                        There are a plethora of protein-based beverages and bars that don’t do a good job adding genuine flavor to the product. As a result, you end up with an unsatisfying meal replacement that creates boredom at best and genuine distaste at worst. Our smoothies use protein sources to complement already great tasting blends with sources such as peanut butter and oats to complement signature smoothies like Nutty Banana and Chocolatey Delight</p>

Almond and Hemp milk are just as good, and all serve as welcome additions to the flavorful smoothies we serve.
